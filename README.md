## Explain what your AI agent does in terms of PEAS. What is the "world" like?

  Our AI agent is a game recommendation agent, that aims to recommmend a game to the user based on their preferences and recommendations of other games they have played in the past.
  In terms of PEAS, we have:
  
  Performance Measure: the feedback that the user gives from the games that have been recommended to them, and how satisfied they are with it. 
  
  Environment: the user profiles and their preferences, along with all of the game data. 
  
  Actuators: the games that the agent recommends to the user based on the preferences. 
  
  Sensors: the information about the game and users that the agent uses to generate personalized recommendations. This includes the game catalog such as genre and ratings and the user preferences such as previous games theyâ€™ve enjoyed, favorite genres, or their budget.

## What kind of agent is it? Goal based? Utility based? etc. 

  The agent is a utility agent because it makes recommendations that optimize for user preferences, increases user engagement, and maximizes the likelihood of users interacting with the recommended games.

## Describe how your agent is set up and where it fits in probabilistic modeling

## Train your first model

## Evaluate your model

## Conclusion section: What is the conclusion of your 1st model? What can be done to possibly improve it?
